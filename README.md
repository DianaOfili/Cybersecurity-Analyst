# Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Analyst Portfolio! This repository showcases a range of projects and skills I have developed while working on various cybersecurity-related tasks. The portfolio highlights my ability to assess security vulnerabilities, implement preventive measures, and respond to incidents. Below you will find a collection of my work and achievements.

## About Me

I am a cybersecurity analyst with a passion for protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure systems. With a focus on data privacy, threat detection, and incident response, I aim to help organizations maintain a robust security posture. My portfolio includes projects involving network security, data protection, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.

## Skills

- **Threat Analysis & Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying and mitigating risks in applications and systems.
- **Incident Response**: Developing strategies for timely and efficient responses to security incidents.
- **Network Security**: Configuring firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
- **Penetration Testing**: Using tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Burp Suite for ethical hacking.
- **Security Audits & Compliance**: Familiar with GDPR, HIPAA, and other security standards.
- **Scripting & Automation**: Automating security processes using Python and Bash scripts.
- **Data Privacy & Encryption**: Implementing secure data storage and transmission techniques.

## Projects

### 1. **Network Security Audit**
   - **Tools Used**: Nmap, Wireshark, Nessus
   - **Overview**: Conducted a comprehensive network security audit for a small business. Identified potential vulnerabilities in their firewall configurations, misconfigured DNS settings, and outdated software. Delivered a report with actionable recommendations for improving network security.

### 2. **Penetration Testing on Web Applications**
   - **Tools Used**: Kali Linux, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP
   - **Overview**: Performed a penetration test on a demo e-commerce web application to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and insecure authentication mechanisms. Presented a report with detailed findings and mitigation strategies.

### 3. **Data Encryption & Privacy Enhancement**
   - **Tools Used**: OpenSSL, PGP
   - **Overview**: Developed a solution for securely encrypting sensitive customer data at rest and in transit. Implemented PGP-based encryption for email communication and integrated AES-256 encryption for database storage.

### 4. **Incident Response Simulation**
   - **Tools Used**: Splunk, TheHive, ELK Stack
   - **Overview**: Created a simulated incident response scenario where I investigated a ransomware attack. Employed tools like Splunk and TheHive for log analysis and incident tracking. Developed a step-by-step response plan, from containment to recovery.

### 5. **Vulnerability Management System**
   - **Tools Used**: OpenVAS, Tenable.io, Python
   - **Overview**: Built an automated vulnerability management system using Python. The system pulls security scan data from OpenVAS and Tenable.io, prioritizes vulnerabilities based on risk, and sends automated alerts to the security team.
